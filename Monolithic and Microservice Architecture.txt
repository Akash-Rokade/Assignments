Monolithic Architechture-

It is a single unit,Normally monlithic application have one large code base If developers want to update or change in code
they access the same code base so they make changes in the whole stack at once.

pros-   start and develop project is simpler
easier to test a structure
deployment is very simple

cons- large code is harder to understand
difficult to integrate new or latest technology

Microservice Architecture-

It is break it down into collection of smaller unit,these units carry out every application process as a separate service
so all service have their own logic and database

pros- software easier to maintain
flexibility in using tech and scalaability

cons- poor perfomance as microservice need to communicate(network latency and message processing)
harder to maintain network(need more LB)

Which one?-
    One approach does not fit all

For a lightweight application monolithic suits better
For complex application microservice suit better
its upto us which to choose
but..Microservice offer a unique kind of modularization they make big solution easier increse productivity offer flexibility in choosing tech.
